Modified ``lsst.utils.timer.time_this`` such that it can now return an object that will contain the duration and, potentially, memory usage when the context closes.
This allows for metrics to be gathered even if no log message is delivered.
As part of this a new ``force_mem_usage`` parameter has been added that will always calculate the (slow) memory statistics even if no log message was to be delivered.
