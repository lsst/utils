    1. Installed Conda packages are obtained via the Conda API. Conda is
       not required.
    2. Python modules (e.g., afw, numpy; galsim is also in this group even
       though we only use it through the library, because no version
       information is currently provided through the library): we get their
       version from the ``__version__`` module variable. Note that this means
       that we're only aware of modules that have already been imported.
    3. Other packages provide no run-time accessible version information (e.g.,
       astrometry_net): we get their version from interrogating the
       environment.  Currently, that means EUPS; if EUPS is replaced or dropped
       then we'll need to consider an alternative means of getting this version
       information.
    4. Local versions of packages (a non-installed EUPS package, selected with
       ``setup -r /path/to/package``): we identify these through the
       environment (EUPS again) and use as a version the path supplemented with
       the ``git`` SHA and, if the git repo isn't clean, an MD5 of the diff.

    These package versions are collected and stored in a Packages object, which
    provides useful comparison and persistence features.

    .. code-block:: python

        from lsst.utils.packages import Packages
        pkgs = Packages.fromSystem()
        print("Current packages:", pkgs)
