class TemplateMeta(type):
    """A metaclass for abstract base classes that tie together wrapped C++
    template types.

    C++ template classes are most easily wrapped with a separate Python class
    for each template type, which results in an unnatural Python interface.
    TemplateMeta provides a thin layer that connects these Python classes by
    giving them a common base class and acting as a factory to construct them
    in a consistent way.

    To use, simply create a new class with the name of the template class, and
    use ``TemplateMeta`` as its metaclass, and then call ``register`` on each
    of its subclasses.  This registers the class with a "type key" - usually a
    Python representation of the C++ template types.  The type key must be a
    hashable object - strings, type objects, and tuples of these (for C++
    classes with multiple template parameters) are good choices.  Alternate
    type keys for existing classes can be added by calling ``alias``, but only
    after a subclass already been registered with a "primary" type key.  For
    example::

    .. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        from ._image import ImageF, ImageD


        class Image(metaclass=TemplateMeta):
            pass


        Image.register(np.float32, ImageF)
        Image.register(np.float64, ImageD)
        Image.alias("F", ImageF)
        Image.alias("D", ImageD)

    We have intentionally used ``numpy`` types as the primary keys for these
    objects in this example, with strings as secondary aliases simply because
    the primary key is added as a ``dtype`` attribute on the the registered
    classes (so ``ImageF.dtype == numpy.float32`` in the above example).

    This allows user code to construct objects directly using ``Image``, as
    long as an extra ``dtype`` keyword argument is passed that matches one of
    the type keys::

    .. code-block:: python

        img = Image(52, 64, dtype=np.float32)

    This simply forwards additional positional and keyword arguments to the
    wrapped template class's constructor.

    The choice of "dtype" as the name of the template parameter is also
    configurable, and in fact multiple template parameters are also supported,
    by setting a ``TEMPLATE_PARAMS`` class attribute on the ABC to a tuple
    containing the names of the template parameters.  A ``TEMPLATE_DEFAULTS``
    attribute can also be defined to a tuple of the same length containing
    default values for the template parameters, allowing them to be omitted in
    constructor calls.  When the length of these attributes is more than one,
    the type keys passed to ``register`` and ``alias`` should be tuple of the
    same length; when the length of these attributes is one, type keys should
    generally not be tuples.

    As an aid for those writing the Python wrappers for C++ classes,
    ``TemplateMeta`` also provides a way to add pure-Python methods and other
    attributes to the wrapped template classes.  To add a ``sum`` method to
    all registered types, for example, we can just do::

    .. code-block:: python

        class Image(metaclass=TemplateMeta):
            def sum(self):
                return np.sum(self.getArray())


        Image.register(np.float32, ImageF)
        Image.register(np.float64, ImageD)

    .. note::

        ``TemplateMeta`` works by overriding the ``__instancecheck__`` and
        ``__subclasscheck__`` special methods, and hence does not appear in
        its registered subclasses' method resolution order or ``__bases__``
        attributes. That means its attributes are not inherited by registered
        subclasses. Instead, attributes added to an instance of
        ``TemplateMeta`` are *copied* into the types registered with it. These
        attributes will thus *replace* existing attributes in those classes
        with the same name, and subclasses cannot delegate to base class
        implementations of these methods.

    Finally, abstract base classes that use ``TemplateMeta`` define a dict-
    like interface for accessing their registered subclasses, providing
    something like the C++ syntax for templates::

    .. code-block:: python

        Image[np.float32] -> ImageF
        Image["D"] -> ImageD

    Both primary dtypes and aliases can be used as keys in this interface,
    which means types with aliases will be present multiple times in the dict.
    To obtain the sequence of unique subclasses, use the ``__subclasses__``
    method.

    .. warning::

        Python's built-in `super` function does not behave properly in classes
        that have `TemplateMeta` as their metaclass (which should be rare, as
        TemplateMeta ABCs will have base classes of their own)..
