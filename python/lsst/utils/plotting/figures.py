    """Make a matplotlib Figure with an Agg-backend canvas.

    This routine creates a matplotlib figure without using
    ``matplotlib.pyplot``, and instead uses a fixed non-interactive
    backend. The advantage is that these figures are not cached and
    therefore do not need to be explicitly closed -- they
    are completely self-contained and ephemeral unlike figures
    created with `matplotlib.pyplot.figure()`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    **kwargs : `dict`
        Keyword arguments to be passed to `matplotlib.figure.Figure()`.

    Returns
    -------
    figure : `matplotlib.figure.Figure`
        Figure with a fixed Agg backend, and no caching.
