def get_caller_name(skip=2):
    """Get the name of the caller method.

    Any item that cannot be determined (or is not relevant, e.g. a free
    function has no class) is silently omitted, along with an
    associated separator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    skip : `int`
        How many levels of stack to skip while getting caller name;
        1 means "who calls me", 2 means "who calls my caller", etc.

    Returns
    -------
    name : `str`
        Name of the caller as a string in the form ``module.class.method``.
        An empty string is returned if ``skip`` exceeds the stack height.

    Notes
    -----
    Adapted from from http://stackoverflow.com/a/9812105
    by adding support to get the class from ``parentframe.f_locals['cls']``
    """
